    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>I was born 26th April 2015 in Egypt, I don't really remember what happened as that was 10 years ago. Let me skip 5 years. 2020, it's covid and we were in qurantine. I, had online school which was really boring because... It's school. Fast-forward to 3 years when I went to my uncle's house. He introduced me to his job which was a Software Engineer and he inspired to start learning to program. That's my history of programming and I've been programming ever since.</p>
